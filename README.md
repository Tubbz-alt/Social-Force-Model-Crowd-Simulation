# Social-Force-Model-Crowd-Simulation
These programs corresponds to different rooms that are compared to eachother in order to find the effect of an obstacle near a door on the evacuation time of a crowd. It also including robustness checks for people with different sizes and weight and rooms with both bad visibility and two doors. 
In order to read the files correctly, make sure pygame is installed on your computer (I assume you already have a working version of Python).
The package at the beginning of the multiple files should also be installed. Besides this make sure the "additional_functions"-file and the "dataset_cm_cv_cr" are in the sama folder as your main file is. 
The other instructions can found in the file your running. Do not hesitate to e-mail me if you find any difficulties trying to use my code.
